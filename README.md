<h1>Instagram Follow Checker</h1>
A Python script to determine which accounts aren't following you back.

<h2>Description</h2>
The script compares the user IDs of your followers and IDs of accounts you follow. It then uses these IDs to determine which accounts that you follow do not follow you back and print their username.

<h2>About the Project</h2>
This was a personal project by Zara to learn and practice Python programming.

<h2>Running the Project</h2>
To run the project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine.(Installation instructions on the official Python website https://www.python.org/downloads/)
You will also need to have json library imported and two json files you can get from instagram(followers.json and following.json)

Once Python is installed, follow these steps to run the script:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ZaraB-hub/Instagram-Follow-Checker.git
Change into the project directory: cd Instagram-Follow-Checker
Run the script: python who_does_not_follow_me.py

You can now check which accounts are not following you back!
